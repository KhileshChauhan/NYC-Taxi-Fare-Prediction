# NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
This is the project for EECS E6893 Big Data Analytics Final Project **NYC Taxi Fare Prediction** (Project ID: 201812-31)

Predicting taxi fares has always been important for our daily life. In this course project we use different predictors and different algorithms to build several models to predict taxi fare in New York City. After finding out the best model we achieve, we analyze the model in many ways and find out the important predictors in the model as well as how each model affects the prediction results. Finally, we make a demo Python application for users to predict taxi fares.

### Files
[Heatmap](Heatmap): Files for a html demonstration graph   
[KaggleData](KaggleData): Data from Kaggle Playground Prediction Competition [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction)

[Application.ipynb](Application.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook file for the Python Application including training   
[Project.ipynb](Project.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook file including some of our machine learning codes and basic interpretation   
[nycmap.png](nycmap.png): A figure used in [Project.ipynb](Project.ipynb)

### Note
The output in [Project.ipynb](Project.ipynb) bases on a very small subset of train test for a demo.   
Before take a test, please download the train dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction) by yourself, and put all dataset and [Project.ipynb](Project.ipynb) in the same root, and make a new folder called `FinalProject` under the same root.
